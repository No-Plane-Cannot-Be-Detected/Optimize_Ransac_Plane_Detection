##### Test conclusion

Our teamâ€™s optimized RANSAC algorithm has the following advantages:

- After comparing with PCL and testing with randomly generated standard plane equations, the plane equations we got are almost identical, verifying the accuracy of the detection plane
- In the speed comparison with PCL, the overall speed is better
- Able to identify multiple planes at once
- You can freely choose whether to use sampling to preprocess the point cloud
- Can identify planes in specific directions

For voxel filtering and sampling, it speeds up the detection of planes in the point cloud, which is more effective and intuitive when identifying multiple planes, but it also has the following problems:

- When the point cloud is relatively small and only a few planes are recognized, the time-consuming proportion of sampling is very large, which weakens its effect
